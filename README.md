Examples using AmeriCommerce's SOAP API via C#

## Notes ##

Some of these are old examples that need to be updated, so this is a work in progress. The cs files in the SimpleExamples subdirectory covers some basic use cases.

There are a lot of hardcoded values in these examples, so even if you provide credentials in the config file, some of these may not work on your own site. You are better off applying this to data that you know will work.

In the future we hope to be able to provide you with something that works out of the box.
